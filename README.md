# Kluenoite
Fedora Kinoite based OCI images with CachyOS Kernel and Addons.

Features :
- Change kernel to cachyOS Bore-EEVDF from COPR
- Add and enable UKSMD from cachyOS addon
- Add Chili SDDM theme

This is considered a personal use image. Try it in a VM to see if it suits you. Or try making your own!

## Installation

> **Warning**
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while!

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/asyrafng/kluenoite:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/asyrafng/kluenoite:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

This repository builds date tags as well, so if you want to rebase to a particular day's build:

```
sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/asyrafng/Kluenoite:20230403
```

This repository by default also supports signing.

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## ISO

This template includes a simple Github Action to build and release an ISO of your image. 

To run the action, simply edit the `boot_menu.yml` by changing all the references to startingpoint to your repository. This should trigger the action automatically.

The Action uses [isogenerator](https://github.com/ublue-os/isogenerator) and works in a similar manner to the official Universal Blue ISO. If you have any issues, you should first check [the documentation page on installation](https://universal-blue.org/installation/). The ISO is a netinstaller and should always pull the latest version of your image.

Note that this release-iso action is not a replacement for a full-blown release automation like [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).
